1.6 Pillars of Oops:
                   1.Class.
                   2.Object and Methods.
                   3.Abstraction.
                   4.Polymorphism.
                   5.Encapsulation.
                   6.Inheritance.
2.Small talk is first purely oops langauge,java python c#,c++ follow oops procedures.

3.Class:
       1.Class is a collection of Variables ,Methods and Objects.
       2.Class is not real word entity,it is logical entity,class just a prototype,blueprint.
       3.class does not occupy memory.
       4.syntax :
       acessmodifires class ClassName{
       methods;
       variables;
       objects;
       nested classes;
       }
       4.Class Name start with capital letter.
       5.if we not define any acess modifire to class then class will default.
4.Method:
       1.Method is a peace of a code will used to perform a certain task.
       2.Advantages:
                   1.Code Reusability.
                   2.Code optimization.
       3.Syntax:
       acessmodifires returntype methodName(parameters){

       }
       4.if method not return anything then write void.
5.Object:
       1.Object is a instance of a class.
       2.Object is a physical entity .
       3.To create an object we need a class so without class we can't create an object.
       4.Only we can define the class to use that class we need to define the object.
       5.Every object is having its own properties.
       6.Through object we can acess variabls and methods.
       7.Object is always inside the main method
       8.For a class we can create n number of objects
       9.We can create Object by following ways:
                                               1.By new Keyword.
                                               2.By new instance method.
                                               3.By clone method.
                                               4.By deserialization.
                                               5.By factory Methods.
       10.Object syntax:
           Employee emp1=new Employee();
           Employee=Class name.
           emp1=Refrence variable of object./instatiation.
           Employee=initialization.
