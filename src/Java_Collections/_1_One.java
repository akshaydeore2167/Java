public class _1_One {

/*
1.Group Objects ia called as collection.e.g collection of students /employees.
2.Collection is a single entity which represents multiple objects.
3.A collection framework is a group of classes and interfaces by which we can
represents group of objects in a single entity.
4.In a array we can store the same kind of data (Homogenious Data)/fixed size data we cant store more
no of data greater than we define if store less no of data so space must be wait/
no under line data structure,ready-made methods are not available need to implement logic.
so to overcome this we can create an object of the array.
5.To perform the operations on a collection we need interfaces and classes.
6.We perform common operations like add object,remove object, search object.
7.Collections is a predefine class which is present in a java.util package which is providing certain no of methods
those methoad we can use to perfom certain operations on a collection object.
8.collection is an interface which comes under collection framework.
9.Collection is main interface and have 3 other child interface.
  List, Set,Queue .
  1.List-:
  Insertion order of object is preserved and duplicates objects are allowed
  List implemented using different classes Linked list,array list,vector.

  2.Set
  Insertion order of object is not preserved and duplicates of objects are not allowed.
  Set implemented using classes Hash set and Linked Hast set

  3.Queue
  Queue is used to prior to process means 1st in 1st out
  Implemented using priority queue.other also other classes are used.
 10.Map Interface.in a map interface we can store the elements in key and value pair.
    keys are not duplicate values cannot be duplicate.
    Map interface implemented using classes Hasp Map and Linked Hasp Map.
 11.Collection Interface having following methods -:
    This methods are common for child Interfaces
      1.add()
      2.addAll()
      3.remove()
      4.removeAll()
      5.retainAll()
      6.clear()
      7.isEmpty()
      8.toArray()
      9.containAll()
